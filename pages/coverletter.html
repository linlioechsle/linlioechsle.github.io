Dear Pixar Hiring Manager,
  <br>
My name is Lin Li Oechsle, and I’m currently a sophomore at Temple University studying computer science and film. 
I’ve come across your listing for a Summer 2020 Editorial Intern, and I feel that this position well suits my interests and strengths, and would be 
an invaluable opportunity to learn more about the film editing process.
  <br>
  <br> 
As someone who is studying both computer science and film, I feel that I have a strong grasp on the important 
intersection of technology and creativity. The problem-solving methods I’ve learned through my programming 
and math classes allow me to look at film editing in a very analytical and systematic way, meanwhile my film 
classes have helped me develop a stronger sense of the bigger picture and the ways in which concepts in my STEM 
classes are interrelated.
  <br>
  <br>
I currently have two years of experience editing video with Adobe Premiere, my first project ever being "Jack in Technicolor," a short noir musical. I had previously dabbled in editing 
in iMovie in my free time, but when I entered my freshman year of college, I felt drawn towards the challenge of editing something "real." I've learned that I'm 
a fan of the trial-by-fire nature of just <i>going for it</i>. Since then, I've edited two other short films, each time learning more about 
all aspects of the filmmaking process.
  <br>
  <br>

<br><br>
While I have not yet had the opportunity to work with Avid, I have a strong aptitude for 
learning new technical skills and feel prepared for the challenge and fast-paced environment at Pixar. I sincerely thank you for your time and consideration for this position.
<br><br>
Sincerely,
Lin Li Oechsle
