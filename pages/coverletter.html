Dear Pixar Hiring Manager,

My name is Lin Li Oechsle, and I’m currently a sophomore at Temple University studying computer science and film. I’ve come across your listing for a Summer 2020 Editorial Intern, and I feel that this position would provide me with a wealth of knowledge and experience in the film industry.

As someone who is studying both computer science and film, I feel that I have a strong grasp on the important intersection of technology and creativity. The problem-solving methods I’ve learned through my programming and math classes allow me to look at film editing in a very analytical and systematic way, meanwhile my film classes have helped me develop a stronger sense of the bigger picture and the ways in which concepts in my STEM classes are interrelated.

I currently have two years of experience editing video with Adobe Premiere. 

I have not had the opportunity 


As a whole, I feel that my research experience, in addition to my unique combination of majors, has provided me with the skills and perspectives that are well suited for this internship position. I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Lin Li Oechsle
